Overview / description of the project:

This is a website designed to allow a user the ability to create a todo list and store the contents of that todo list in a redux store.  It also has a contact page that stores the user's information in a redux store.  

Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered: 

You use the todo list by navigating to that page and typing in the list of todos.  From there you can cross an item off of the list or remove it entirely.  You are also able to view all items, active items, and completed items seperatly.  The contact form you fill out according to the requested information and submit. 

Technologies Used:

Ideas for future improvement:

1. Thouroughly study the material so that I fully understand the functionality. 
2. Create a button so that the user can have multiple todos open.
3. Write-in the backend so that user information can be stored with filled out todo lists.
